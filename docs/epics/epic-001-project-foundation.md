# Epic 001: Project Foundation & Infrastructure Setup

## Epic Goal
Establish the foundational infrastructure for the LLM Server Monitoring System, including repository structure, Docker Compose configurations, and CI/CD pipeline basics to enable all subsequent development work.

## Epic Description

**Purpose:**
Create the core infrastructure and development environment for the monitoring system. This epic lays the groundwork for both mock and real implementations, ensuring a consistent development experience across the team.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Monorepo structure with all required directories
- Docker Compose configurations for different environments
- Basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Development environment setup scripts
- Initial documentation structure

## User Stories

### Story 1: Initialize Repository Structure
**As a** developer  
**I want** a well-organized monorepo structure  
**So that** all team members know where to place and find components

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create directory structure as defined in architecture
- Initialize Python package structure for exporters
- Set up .gitignore for Python/Docker/Node artifacts
- Create README.md with project overview
- Add CLAUDE.md for AI assistant context

### Story 2: Docker Compose Environment Setup
**As a** developer  
**I want** Docker Compose configurations for different environments  
**So that** I can easily spin up the monitoring stack

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create docker-compose.yml (base configuration)
- Create docker-compose.dev.yml (development overrides)
- Create docker-compose.mock.yml (mock data configuration)
- Create docker-compose.prod.yml (production configuration)
- Add .env.example with all required variables
- Test all configurations start successfully

### Story 3: Development Scripts and Tools
**As a** developer  
**I want** utility scripts for common tasks  
**So that** I can efficiently manage the development environment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create scripts/setup/install-dependencies.sh
- Create scripts/setup/setup-nvidia-toolkit.sh
- Create scripts/development/start-dev.sh
- Create scripts/development/stop-dev.sh
- Create scripts/development/reset-data.sh
- Add Makefile with common commands
- Test all scripts on Ubuntu 24.04

### Story 4: CI/CD Pipeline Foundation
**As a** team lead  
**I want** basic CI/CD pipelines  
**So that** code quality is maintained automatically

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create .github/workflows/ci.yaml for continuous integration
- Create .github/workflows/build-images.yaml for Docker builds
- Set up Python linting (ruff) and formatting (black)
- Configure pytest for running tests
- Add pre-commit hooks configuration
- Ensure all workflows pass on initial commit

## Technical Requirements

**Infrastructure:**
- Ubuntu 24.04 compatibility
- Docker Engine with Compose v2
- Python 3.12 environment
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit support

**Development Tools:**
- git for version control
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python virtual environment
- VS Code with recommended extensions

## Dependencies
- None (this is the foundational epic)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All directory structures created per architecture
- [ ] All Docker Compose files tested and working
- [ ] All development scripts executable and tested
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines running successfully
- [ ] Documentation updated (README, CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Code passes all linting and formatting checks
- [ ] Team can clone and start development environment

## Estimated Effort
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Team Size:** 1-2 developers
- **Priority:** Critical (blocks all other work)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk:** Environment setup issues on different systems
- **Mitigation:** Test on fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM, document prerequisites
- **Risk:** Docker Compose compatibility issues
- **Mitigation:** Pin Docker Compose version, test all configurations

## Notes
- This epic must be completed before any other development begins
- Focus on developer experience and ease of onboarding
- All configurations should work out-of-the-box with minimal setup
