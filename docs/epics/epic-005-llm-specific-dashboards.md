# Epic 005: LLM-Specific Dashboards

## Epic Goal
Create specialized dashboards for LLM operations including LiteLLM proxy status, vLLM container monitoring, model catalog visualization, and LangFuse analytics to provide comprehensive insights into model serving infrastructure.

## Epic Description

**Purpose:**
Develop LLM-specific monitoring dashboards that provide visibility into model serving, request routing, performance metrics, and usage analytics. These dashboards are critical for ML engineers and model operators to ensure optimal model serving.

**Key Deliverables:**
- LiteLLM Status Dashboard with model routing
- vLLM Docker Status Dashboard with GPU mapping
- Model Catalog Dashboard
- LangFuse Analytics Dashboard
- Unified model performance view

## User Stories

  - Model name and type (LLM/Embedding/Reranker)
  - Endpoint URLs
  - Current status (available/loading/error)
  - Health check status
- Add request metrics panels:
  - Requests per minute/hour/day (time selector)
  - Request distribution by model
  - Success vs error rates
- Add token usage visualizations:
  - Input/output tokens per minute/hour/day
  - Token usage by model
  - Cost estimation panels
- Add response time analytics:
  - P50/P90/P99 latencies
  - Latency distribution histograms
  - Slow query analysis
- Include queue depth monitoring
- Add model metadata table

### Story 3: Model Catalog Dashboard
**As a** end user  
**I want** a comprehensive model catalog view  
**So that** I can discover available models and endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create searchable model catalog table:
  - Model name and ID
  - Model type (LLM/Embedding/Reranker)
  - Provider (vLLM/LiteLLM)
  - Endpoint URL
  - Model size and quantization
  - Hugging Face link
- Add model availability indicators
- Include model capabilities matrix
- Add usage examples panel
- Create model comparison view
- Add version information
- Include deprecation notices
- Add quick copy for endpoints

### Story 4: LangFuse Analytics Dashboard
**As a** product manager  
**I want** usage analytics and quality metrics  
**So that** I can make data-driven decisions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create usage trend panels:
  - Total traces over time
  - Unique users
  - Request patterns
  - Peak usage times
- Add token economics:
  - Token usage by model
  - Cost analysis
  - Budget tracking
  - Usage forecasting
- Add quality metrics:
  - Error rates by model
  - Performance scores
  - User feedback scores
  - Model comparison
- Create user activity heatmap
- Add detailed trace explorer
- Include export functionality

### Story 5: Performance Comparison Dashboard
**As a** ML engineer  
**I want** to compare model performance  
**So that** I can optimize model selection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create model comparison matrix:
  - Side-by-side performance metrics
  - Latency comparisons
  - Throughput analysis
  - Cost per request
- Add A/B test visualizations
- Include quality score trends
- Add resource efficiency metrics
- Create model recommendation panel
- Add performance anomaly detection
- Include historical comparisons

## Technical Requirements

**Data Integration:**
- LiteLLM API metrics
- vLLM metrics endpoints
- Docker API for containers
- LangFuse API/database
- Hugging Face metadata

**Visualization Types:**
- Matrix/grid layouts
- Time series with aggregation
- Distribution histograms
- Heatmaps
- Sortable tables
- Tag clouds

**User Experience:**
- Search and filter capabilities
- Export functionality
- Deep linking
- Mobile responsive
- Accessibility compliant

## Dependencies
- Epic 002: Mock Data Infrastructure (data source)
- Epic 003: Core Monitoring Stack (platform)
- Epic 004: System Dashboards (patterns established)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All four LLM dashboards created
- [ ] Mock data properly integrated
- [ ] Search and filtering functional
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Visual consistency maintained
- [ ] Export capabilities working
- [ ] Documentation complete
