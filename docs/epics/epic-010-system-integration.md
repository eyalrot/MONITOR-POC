# Epic 010: System Integration

## Epic Goal
Seamlessly integrate all real exporters with the monitoring stack, replacing mock exporters while validating data flows, ensuring dashboard compatibility, and establishing production-ready monitoring.

## Epic Description

**Purpose:**
Bring together all system components by replacing mock exporters with real ones, configuring Prometheus scraping, setting up log aggregation, and validating the complete data pipeline from sources to dashboards.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Mock-to-real exporter migration
- Prometheus scrape configuration
- Promtail log collection setup
- Data flow validation
- Performance optimization
- Alert rule configuration

## User Stories

### Story 1: Mock Exporter Migration
**As a** platform engineer  
**I want** to replace mock with real exporters  
**So that** we monitor actual infrastructure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create migration plan with rollback strategy
- Replace exporters one by one:
  - Node exporter first (least risk)
  - Container exporter second
  - GPU exporter (validate carefully)
  - LLM exporters last
- Validate metric compatibility
- Compare mock vs real data
- Update docker-compose configs
- Test dashboard functionality
- Document any metric differences

### Story 2: Prometheus Configuration
**As a** monitoring engineer  
**I want** optimized Prometheus configuration  
**So that** metrics are collected efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Configure scrape jobs for all exporters
- Set appropriate scrape intervals:
  - Infrastructure: 30 seconds
  - LLM metrics: 60 seconds
  - Slow-changing: 5 minutes
- Add target labels and relabeling
- Configure service discovery
- Implement recording rules
- Optimize retention (30 days)
- Add federation endpoints
- Test scrape performance

### Story 3: Log Aggregation Pipeline
**As a** developer  
**I want** centralized log collection  
**So that** I can troubleshoot effectively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Deploy Promtail on all nodes
- Configure container log collection
- Set up log parsing rules:
  - JSON log detection
  - Error pattern extraction
  - Timestamp parsing
  - Label extraction
- Implement log filtering
- Configure Loki limits
- Test log search performance
- Add log retention policies

### Story 4: Data Validation Suite
**As a** QA engineer  
**I want** comprehensive data validation  
**So that** monitoring data is accurate

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create validation test suite:
  - Metric presence checks
  - Value range validation
  - Label consistency
  - Time series continuity
- Compare against baselines
- Implement drift detection
- Add data quality metrics
- Create validation dashboards
- Set up integrity alerts
- Document expected values

### Story 5: Performance Optimization
**As a** operations engineer  
**I want** optimized monitoring performance  
**So that** overhead is minimized

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Benchmark current performance
- Optimize problem areas:
  - Query performance
  - Cardinality management
  - Storage efficiency
  - Network bandwidth
- Implement caching strategies
- Add query optimization
- Configure downsampling
- Test under load
- Document performance targets

## Technical Requirements

**Integration Points:**
- Prometheus scrape endpoints
- Loki push API
- Grafana data sources
- Docker networking
- Service discovery

**Performance Targets:**
- <2% CPU overhead
- <500MB memory per exporter
- <30s dashboard load time
- <1s metric query response
- 99.9% data availability

**Compatibility:**
- Metric name matching
- Label consistency
- Unit compatibility
- Aggregation support

## Dependencies
- Epic 007-009: All exporters ready
- Epic 003: Monitoring stack deployed
- Epic 004-006: Dashboards created
- Production access approved

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All real exporters deployed
- [ ] Mock exporters decommissioned
- [ ] Prometheus scraping all targets
- [ ] Logs being collected
- [ ] All dashboards functional
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Estimated Effort
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Team Size:** 2 developers
- **Priority:** Critical (system completion)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk:** Data incompatibility
- **Mitigation:** Gradual rollout, validation tests
- **Risk:** Performance degradation
- **Mitigation:** Benchmark before/after, optimization
- **Risk:** Service disruption
- **Mitigation:** Rollback plan, phased migration

## Notes
- Test thoroughly in staging first
- Keep mock exporters as fallback
- Monitor the monitoring system
- Plan for gradual rollout
