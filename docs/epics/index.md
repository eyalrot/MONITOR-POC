- Duration: 1.5 weeks
- Priority: High

**[Epic 006: Operational Dashboards](./epic-006-operational-dashboards.md)**
- Log Explorer, System Announcements, Performance Trends
- Duration: 1 week
- Priority: Medium

### Phase 3: Real Exporter Development (Weeks 3-6)
*Can run in parallel with Phase 2*

**[Epic 007: Base Exporter Framework](./epic-007-base-exporter-framework.md)**
- Python base framework for all exporters
- Duration: 1 week
- Priority: Critical (blocks exporters)

**[Epic 008: Infrastructure Exporters](./epic-008-infrastructure-exporters.md)**
- Node, GPU, and Container exporters
- Duration: 1.5 weeks
- Priority: High

**[Epic 009: LLM Integration Exporters](./epic-009-llm-integration-exporters.md)**
- LiteLLM, vLLM, and LangFuse exporters
- Duration: 2 weeks
- Priority: High

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Weeks 6-7)

**[Epic 010: System Integration](./epic-010-system-integration.md)**
- Replace mock with real exporters, validate data flows
- Duration: 1 week
- Priority: Critical

**[Epic 011: Testing & Quality Assurance](./epic-011-testing-quality-assurance.md)**
- Unit, integration, and AI-driven E2E testing
- Duration: 1.5 weeks
- Priority: High

### Phase 5: Operationalization (Week 8)

## Key Principles

1. **Parallel Development**: Phase 2 (Dashboards) and Phase 3 (Exporters) can run simultaneously thanks to mock data infrastructure

2. **Incremental Integration**: Replace mock exporters one at a time to reduce risk

3. **Early Validation**: Mock data allows testing dashboards before real exporters are ready

4. **Quality First**: Comprehensive testing including AI-driven E2E tests

5. **Production Ready**: Full operationalization with documentation and automation

## Success Metrics

- All 12 epics completed within 8 weeks
- Zero blocking dependencies between parallel phases
- >90% test coverage on all components
- <2% monitoring overhead on production systems
- 100% dashboard compatibility between mock and real data

## Risk Management

Each epic includes specific risk mitigation strategies. Key overall risks:

1. **External API Dependencies**: Mitigated by mock implementations and fallback strategies
2. **Performance Impact**: Mitigated by optimization epics and performance testing
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Mitigated by maintaining consistent interfaces between mock and real exporters
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Mitigated by comprehensive documentation and CLAUDE.md

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve epic definitions
2. Assign teams to Phase 1 epics
3. Set up project tracking
4. Schedule regular epic review meetings
5. Begin Epic 001 immediately
