# Epic 003: Core Monitoring Stack Deployment

## Epic Goal
Deploy and configure the core monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana) with proper data source connections, authentication, and persistence to provide the foundation for both mock and real metrics visualization.

## Epic Description

**Purpose:**
Establish the core monitoring stack that will serve as the central nervous system for all metrics collection, storage, and visualization. This infrastructure must support both Phase 1 mock data and Phase 2+ real data seamlessly.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Prometheus deployment with proper retention
- Loki deployment for log aggregation
- Grafana deployment with authentication
- Data source configurations
- Volume persistence setup
- Basic security configuration

## User Stories

### Story 1: Prometheus Deployment and Configuration
**As a** platform engineer  
**I want** Prometheus deployed with proper configuration  
**So that** metrics can be collected and stored reliably

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Deploy Prometheus v2.x on port 23001
- Configure 30-second scrape interval
- Set up 30-day retention policy
- Create prometheus.yml with job configurations
- Configure scrape targets for all exporters
- Set up Docker volume for data persistence
- Verify mock exporters are being scraped
- Add recording rules for common queries

### Story 2: Loki Deployment for Log Aggregation
**As a** platform engineer  
**I want** Loki deployed for centralized logging  
**So that** container logs can be searched and analyzed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Deploy Loki v2.x on port 23002
- Configure 30-day log retention
- Set up Docker volume for log storage
- Create loki-config.yml with proper limits
- Deploy Promtail for log collection
- Configure Promtail to scrape container logs
- Verify logs are being ingested
- Test log queries work correctly

### Story 3: Grafana Deployment with Authentication
**As a** security-conscious admin  
**I want** Grafana deployed with proper authentication  
**So that** dashboards are protected from unauthorized access

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Deploy Grafana latest on port 23000
- Configure basic authentication (username/password)
- Set up admin user with environment variables
- Configure grafana.ini for internal network
- Set up Docker volume for persistence
- Disable user registration
- Configure session timeout
- Add startup provisioning configuration

### Story 4: Data Source Configuration
**As a** dashboard developer  
**I want** all data sources properly configured  
**So that** I can create dashboards immediately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Configure Prometheus as default data source
- Configure Loki data source for logs
- Set up automatic provisioning via YAML
- Test queries work from Grafana
- Configure proper timeouts
- Add data source health checks
- Document query examples
- Verify mock data is queryable

### Story 5: Monitoring Stack Integration
**As a** operations engineer  
**I want** all monitoring components integrated  
**So that** the system works as a cohesive unit

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All components start with docker-compose up
- Health checks pass for all services
- Grafana can query both Prometheus and Loki
- Volumes persist data across restarts
- Network connectivity verified between services
- Resource limits configured appropriately
- Startup order dependencies handled
- Graceful shutdown implemented

## Technical Requirements

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker Compose v2 orchestration
- Docker volumes for persistence
- Internal Docker network
- Health check endpoints

**Configuration:**
- Environment variable injection
- YAML-based provisioning
- Volume mount for configs
- Startup order management

**Security:**
- Basic auth for Grafana
- Internal network isolation
- No external exposure
- Secure defaults

## Dependencies
- Epic 001: Project Foundation (completed)
- Epic 002: Mock Data Infrastructure (running containers)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All three services deployed and healthy
- [ ] Data persistence verified across restarts
- [ ] Authentication working for Grafana
- [ ] Data sources auto-provisioned
- [ ] Mock data visible in Grafana
- [ ] Logs searchable in Grafana
- [ ] Docker Compose configuration complete
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Estimated Effort
- **Duration:** 3-4 days
- **Team Size:** 1 developer
- **Priority:** Critical (blocks dashboard development)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk:** Version compatibility issues
- **Mitigation:** Pin all image versions, test thoroughly
- **Risk:** Data loss on container restart
- **Mitigation:** Proper volume configuration, backup scripts
- **Risk:** Performance issues with retention
- **Mitigation:** Configure appropriate retention, monitor disk usage

## Notes
- This stack serves both development and production
- Configuration should support easy migration from mock to real data
- Focus on reliability and ease of maintenance
