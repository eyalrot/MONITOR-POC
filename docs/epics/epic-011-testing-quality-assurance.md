# Epic 011: Testing & Quality Assurance

## Epic Goal
Establish comprehensive testing strategies including unit tests, integration tests, and AI-driven E2E testing using MCP servers to ensure system reliability and catch regressions before production deployment.

## Epic Description

**Purpose:**
Implement a multi-layered testing approach that validates individual components, integration points, and end-to-end workflows. Leverage AI-driven testing with existing MCP servers for intelligent test generation and visual regression testing.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Unit test suite for all exporters
- Integration tests for data flows
- AI-driven E2E tests with MCP
- Visual regression with Percy
- Performance test suite
- CI/CD test automation

## User Stories

### Story 1: Unit Testing Framework

- Mock external dependencies
- Test error conditions
- Add performance benchmarks
- Configure pytest with coverage
- Set up test reporting

### Story 2: Integration Testing Suite
**As a** QA engineer  
**I want** integration tests  
**So that** components work together correctly

  - Prometheus → Grafana
  - Logs → Loki → Grafana
  - API integrations
- Add docker-compose test env
- Test configuration changes
- Validate metric aggregations
- Test failure scenarios
- Add data consistency checks
- Implement test data generation
- Create test result dashboards

### Story 3: AI-Driven E2E Testing
**As a** test engineer  
**I want** AI-powered dashboard testing  
**So that** UI functionality is validated intelligently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Configure MCP servers:
  - Playwright MCP for browser control
  - Screenshot MCP for captures
  - Filesystem MCP for results
- Create test scenarios:
  - Dashboard navigation
  - Time range selection
  - Filter interactions
  - Alert triggering
  - Data validation
- Implement Claude orchestration
- Add intelligent assertions
- Generate test reports
- Create test case library

### Story 4: Visual Regression Testing
**As a** UI developer  
**I want** visual regression testing  
**So that** dashboard changes are tracked

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integrate Percy for screenshots
- Configure visual tests for:
  - All dashboard views
  - Different screen sizes
  - Dark/light themes
  - Data states
- Set comparison thresholds
- Ignore dynamic elements
- Add approval workflow
- Create baseline images
- Document visual changes
- Add CI/CD integration

### Story 5: Performance Testing
**As a** performance engineer  
**I want** load and stress tests  
**So that** system limits are known

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create performance test suite:
  - Exporter stress tests
  - Query performance tests
  - Dashboard load tests
  - Concurrent user tests
- Define performance baselines
- Add resource monitoring
- Test scaling limits
- Implement chaos testing
- Create performance reports
- Add regression detection
- Document bottlenecks

## Technical Requirements

**Testing Stack:**
- pytest for Python tests
- Playwright for browser automation
- Percy for visual testing
- Locust for load testing
- Docker for test environments

**MCP Configuration:**
```yaml
mcpServers:
  playwright:
    command: npx
    args: [-y, @modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright]
  screenshot:
    command: npx
    args: [-y, @modelcontextprotocol/server-screenshot]
  filesystem:
    command: npx
    args: [-y, @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem]
```

**CI/CD Integration:**
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Test result artifacts
- Coverage reports
- Performance trends
- Automated alerts

## Dependencies
- Epic 001-010: System components ready
- MCP servers installed
- Percy account setup
- CI/CD infrastructure

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Unit tests >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] E2E tests automated
- [ ] Visual baselines created
- [ ] Performance baselines set
- [ ] CI/CD integration complete
- [ ] Test documentation written
- [ ] Team trained on tools

## Estimated Effort
- **Duration:** 1.5 weeks
- **Team Size:** 2 developers + 1 QA
- **Priority:** High (quality assurance)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk:** Test maintenance overhead
- **Mitigation:** Focus on stable interfaces, good practices
- **Risk:** Flaky E2E tests
- **Mitigation:** Retry logic, environment isolation
- **Risk:** Slow test execution
- **Mitigation:** Parallel execution, test optimization

## Notes
- Tests are first-class citizens
- Invest in test infrastructure
- Make tests easy to run locally
- Focus on meaningful coverage
