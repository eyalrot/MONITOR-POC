# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** LLM Server Maintainer,  
**I want** to initialize the monitoring project repository with proper structure and base configurations,  
**so that** I have a solid foundation for developing and deploying the monitoring system

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create project repository structure according to the monorepo design in the architecture
2. Initialize Docker Compose configuration with required services defined
3. Set up .env template with all required environment variables
4. Create README with setup instructions for developers and users

  - [x] Create root directory and initialize git repository
  - [x] Create directory structure according to unified-project-structure.md
  - [x] Create placeholder files for key directories (README.md in each)
- [x] Task 2: Set up Docker Compose foundation (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create docker/ directory
  - [x] Create docker-compose.yml with service definitions for Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki
  - [x] Define network configuration for internal communication
  - [x] Set up volume definitions for persistent data storage
- [x] Task 3: Configure environment variables (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create .env.example file with all required variables
  - [x] Document each environment variable with description and default value
  - [x] Include variables for ports (23000, 23001, 23002), data retention, and service configurations
- [x] Task 4: Create project documentation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Write README.md with project overview and purpose
  - [x] Add quick start guide for developers

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Root: `llm-monitor/`
- Docker configs: `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Scripts: `scripts/setup/`, `scripts/development/`, `scripts/maintenance/`
- Config files: `config/prometheus/`, `config/grafana/`, `config/loki/`, `config/promtail/`
- Documentation: `docs/`
- Environment template: `.env.example`

### Testing Requirements
From testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- No automated tests required for initial setup
- Manual verification of directory structure creation
- Manual testing of Docker Compose configuration validity

### Technical Constraints
- Platform: Ubuntu 24.04 [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]
- Docker Compose v2 required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- All components must be containerized [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]
- Internal network only, no external access [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-monitoring-system-rules]
- Ports: Grafana (23000), Prometheus (23001), Loki (23002) [Source: prd.md#core-components]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`
- Test standards: pytest 8.x for Python testing
- Testing frameworks: pytest for backend, Playwright with MCP for E2E
- Specific requirements for this story: Manual verification only for project initialization
