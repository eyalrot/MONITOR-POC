## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Project structure successfully created with all directories in place
- Docker Compose foundation established with network and volume configurations
- Development scripts (start-dev.sh, stop-dev.sh) are available for testing
- .env.example contains environment variable templates ready for use

### Data Models
No specific data models required for Prometheus setup. Prometheus will store time-series data following its internal schema.

### API Specifications
No API implementations in this story. Prometheus exposes its own API on port 23001.

### Component Specifications
Prometheus Server Component [Source: architecture/components.md#prometheus-server]:
- **Image**: prom/prometheus:v2.x (use latest v2 release)
- **Port**: 23001 (external) → 9090 (internal)
- **Purpose**: Time-series database for metrics collection
- **Configuration**: Via prometheus.yml file mounted as volume

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Prometheus config: `config/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- Docker service update: `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Alert rules (future): `config/prometheus/rules/` directory
- Volume mount: `prometheus-data` Docker volume

### Testing Requirements
From testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Integration test location: `tests/integration/test_prometheus_scrape.py`
- Test that Prometheus can scrape its own metrics
- Validate configuration file syntax before deployment
- Manual verification of UI access and data retention settings

### Technical Constraints
- **Prometheus Version**: 2.x (latest stable) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Scrape Interval**: 30 seconds (must be respected) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-monitoring-system-rules]
- **Data Retention**: 30 days [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]
- **Port Assignment**: 23001 for external access [Source: prd.md#core-components]
- **Network**: Internal only, no external access [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-monitoring-system-rules]
- **Container Health**: Must expose /health endpoint [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-monitoring-system-rules]

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths align with the defined project structure. The `config/prometheus/` directory should already exist from story 1.1 implementation.

## Testing
### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `tests/integration/test_prometheus_scrape.py`
- Test standards: pytest 8.x for Python testing
- Testing frameworks: Integration tests for service connectivity
- Specific requirements for this story: 
  - Validate prometheus.yml syntax
  - Test Prometheus can start and scrape itself
  - Verify retention configuration is applied
  - Manual UI access verification

## QA Results

### QA Review Summary
**Review Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)  
**Verdict:** ✅ **APPROVED with Minor Recommendations**

### Code Quality Assessment

#### 1. **Implementation Quality (9/10)**
**Strengths:**
- Prometheus v2.54.1 correctly implemented with proper health checks
- Configuration adheres to all technical constraints (30s scrape interval, 30d retention)
- Volume mounts properly fixed from relative to parent-relative paths
- Container is running healthy with correct port mapping (23001:9090)

**Minor Issues:**
- The `version: '3.8'` attribute in docker-compose.yml generates warnings (though harmless)

#### 2. **Configuration Review (10/10)**
**Excellent:**
- prometheus.yml follows best practices with clear comments
- Placeholder jobs prepared for future exporters with consistent labeling
- Global settings correctly set (30s intervals as required)
- Rule files directory properly configured for future alert rules

#### 3. **Testing Strategy (8/10)**
**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive integration tests covering all critical aspects
- Tests verify configuration syntax, scrape intervals, retention, and health
- Test structure follows pytest best practices with fixtures

**Improvements Needed:**
- Tests require manual pytest installation (no automated test execution in CI/CD yet)
- Missing negative test cases (what happens with invalid config?)

#### 4. **Architecture Compliance (10/10)**
**Perfect Alignment:**
- ✅ Scrape interval: 30 seconds (verified)
- ✅ Data retention: 30 days (verified via API)
- ✅ Port assignment: 23001 (verified)
- ✅ Health check endpoint: Properly configured
- ✅ Internal network only: Correctly isolated
- ✅ File locations: All paths match project structure

### Security & Performance Review

#### Security (9/10)
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data
- Internal network isolation properly configured
- Environment variables used for configuration
- Minor: Consider adding basic auth for Prometheus UI in production

#### Performance (10/10)
- Resource usage appropriate for monitoring system
- 30-second scrape interval prevents metric explosion
- Health checks configured with sensible intervals

### Refactoring Performed
As a senior developer, I've identified these improvements that should be considered in future stories:

1. **Docker Compose Version Warning:**
   ```yaml
   # Remove the version line from docker-compose.yml to eliminate warnings
   version: '3.8'  # This line should be removed
   ```

2. **Test Automation Gap:**
   - Consider adding a `make test-integration` target that installs dependencies
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing

3. **Configuration Validation:**
   - Consider adding a pre-deployment validation script
   - Implement configuration hot-reload capability

### Test Results Verification
- ✅ Container running and healthy
- ✅ Prometheus self-scraping working
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Retention configured as 30d
- ✅ UI accessible at http://localhost:23001

### Recommendations for Next Stories

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Remove docker-compose version attribute in next story
   - Set up automated test execution in CI/CD

2. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Implement Prometheus recording rules for common queries
   - Add alerting rules for Prometheus self-monitoring
   - Consider adding Prometheus push gateway for batch jobs

### Final Assessment
The implementation is **production-ready** with excellent adherence to requirements and coding standards. The developer demonstrated good debugging skills when fixing the volume mount issues. The comprehensive test suite provides confidence in the deployment.

**Quality Score: 93/100**

The story successfully establishes a solid Prometheus foundation for the monitoring system. All acceptance criteria are met, and the implementation follows best practices.
