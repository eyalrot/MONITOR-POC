# Story 1.4: CI/CD Pipeline Foundation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** team lead,  
**I want** basic CI/CD pipelines,

2. Create .github/workflows/build-images.yaml for Docker builds
3. Set up Python linting (ruff) and formatting (black)
4. Configure pytest for running tests
5. Add pre-commit hooks configuration
6. Ensure all workflows pass on initial commit

  - [x] Add hooks for ruff (linting)
  - [x] Add hooks for black (formatting)
  - [x] Add hooks for trailing whitespace
  - [x] Add hooks for YAML validation
  - [x] Document pre-commit setup in README
- [x] Task 6: Create test configuration (AC: 4)
  - [x] Update requirements-test.txt with CI dependencies
  - [x] Create pytest.ini or update pyproject.toml with pytest config
  - [x] Add test coverage configuration
  - [x] Create conftest.py for shared test fixtures
- [x] Task 7: Verify and test workflows (AC: 6)
  - [x] Run workflows locally using act (if available)
  - [x] Commit and push to trigger workflows
  - [x] Verify all checks pass
  - [x] Fix any issues found during initial run

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion:
- Testing infrastructure started with requirements-test.txt containing pytest==8.3.3
- Integration tests created in tests/integration/
- Project uses pytest 8.x for testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### GitHub Actions Configuration
Based on deployment architecture [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#cicd-pipeline]:
- Platform: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Container Registry: ghcr.io (GitHub Container Registry)
- Build Tool: Docker with buildx for multi-platform support

### Python Tooling Requirements
From tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- **Backend Language**: Python 3.12
- **Backend Testing**: pytest 8.x
- **Linting**: ruff (modern Python linter)
- **Formatting**: black (Python code formatter)

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- GitHub workflows: `.github/workflows/` directory
- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`
- Build workflow: `.github/workflows/build-images.yaml`
- Python config: `pyproject.toml` in project root
- Pre-commit config: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in project root

### Testing Requirements
From testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test organization follows testing pyramid approach
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- E2E tests in `tests/e2e/`
- All Python code must have corresponding tests

### Docker Build Requirements
From existing docker-compose.yml:
- Base images already defined in docker-compose.yml
- Exporters will be built from `exporters/*/Dockerfile`
- Use Docker buildx for efficient layer caching

### CI/CD Best Practices
- Run CI on all pushes and pull requests
- Fail fast - order jobs by speed (linting before tests)
- Cache dependencies between runs
- Use matrix builds for multiple Python versions if needed
- Tag Docker images with git SHA and branch name

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing project structure
- GitHub Actions must be used (per architecture docs)
- All existing tests must pass in CI
- Docker builds must succeed for all exporters
- Pre-commit hooks should not block development

## Testing
### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: tests/ directory with unit/, integration/, e2e/ subdirectories
- Test standards: pytest 8.x for Python testing
- Testing frameworks: pytest with coverage reporting
- Specific requirements for this story:
  - CI must run all existing tests
  - Test coverage should be reported (even if low initially)
  - Linting must pass for all Python files
  - Docker builds must complete successfully
