# Story 1.5: Container Metrics Setup

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** LLM Server Maintainer,  
**I want** to monitor Docker container resource usage,  
**so that** I can track container performance and resource allocation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Deploy cAdvisor for container metrics collection
2. Configure Docker socket access for cAdvisor
3. Set up Prometheus scraping for cAdvisor metrics
4. Test container metrics visibility in Prometheus
5. Verify GPU container metrics are properly tagged

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Deploy cAdvisor container (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add cAdvisor service to docker-compose.yml
  - [ ] Configure cAdvisor image (gcr.io/cadvisor/cadvisor:latest)
  - [ ] Set up port mapping (8080 for metrics endpoint)
  - [ ] Configure container health check endpoint
- [ ] Task 2: Configure Docker socket access (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Mount Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) as read-only
  - [ ] Set up required volume mounts for system access
  - [ ] Configure cgroup mounts for container metrics
  - [ ] Add necessary device mounts for full metric collection
- [ ] Task 3: Configure Prometheus scraping (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Update config/prometheus/prometheus.yml with cAdvisor job
  - [ ] Configure scrape interval (30 seconds as per standards)
  - [ ] Add appropriate metric relabeling if needed
  - [ ] Restart Prometheus to load new configuration
- [ ] Task 4: Verify metrics collection (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Access cAdvisor UI at http://localhost:8080
  - [ ] Verify container list shows all running containers
  - [ ] Check Prometheus targets page shows cAdvisor as UP
  - [ ] Query sample container metrics in Prometheus
- [ ] Task 5: Validate GPU container detection (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Verify GPU-enabled containers have device labels
  - [ ] Check container_gpu_* metrics are available
  - [ ] Ensure vLLM containers are properly identified
  - [ ] Document any GPU-specific metric labels
- [ ] Task 6: Add integration tests (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create tests/integration/test_cadvisor_setup.py
  - [ ] Test cAdvisor endpoint accessibility
  - [ ] Test Prometheus scraping of cAdvisor metrics
  - [ ] Verify key container metrics are present

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From completed stories:
- Prometheus successfully deployed on port 23001 with 30-second scrape interval
- Docker Compose uses ../config volume mount pattern
- Integration test pattern established in tests/integration/
- Docker compose v2 syntax (no version declaration needed)
- Health checks use standard patterns (/health or specific endpoints)

### Data Models
No specific data models required. cAdvisor exposes standard Prometheus metrics following the container_* namespace pattern.

### API Specifications
cAdvisor exposes the following endpoints [Source: architecture/components.md#container-metrics-exporter]:
- Metrics endpoint: `/metrics` on port 8080 for Prometheus scraping
- Web UI: `/` on port 8080 for container visualization
- Container API: `/api/v1.3/containers` for direct container data

### Component Specifications
Container Metrics Exporter Component [Source: architecture/components.md#container-metrics-exporter]:
- **Responsibility**: Monitor Docker container resource usage
- **Port**: 8080 (Prometheus metrics endpoint)
- **Technology**: cAdvisor (Google's container advisor)
- **Key Interfaces**: 
  - Prometheus metrics endpoint on port 8080
  - Container listing API
  - cAdvisor-compatible metrics

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Docker service update: `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Prometheus config update: `config/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_cadvisor_setup.py`
- No custom exporter needed (using standard cAdvisor image)

### Testing Requirements
From testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Integration test location: `tests/integration/test_cadvisor_setup.py`
- Test that cAdvisor starts and responds to health checks
- Verify Prometheus can scrape cAdvisor metrics
- Test that container metrics include proper labels
- Manual verification of GPU container detection

### Technical Constraints
- **cAdvisor Version**: Latest stable [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Port Assignment**: 8080 for metrics endpoint (standard cAdvisor port)
- **Scrape Interval**: 30 seconds (must be respected) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-monitoring-system-rules]
- **Network**: Internal only, no external access [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-monitoring-system-rules]
- **Container Health**: Must expose health endpoint [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-monitoring-system-rules]
- **Docker Access**: Read-only socket mount for security
- **Metric Naming**: Follow container_* namespace pattern

### Project Structure Notes
- No custom exporter directory needed - using standard cAdvisor image
- Configuration changes limited to docker-compose.yml and prometheus.yml
- Follows established patterns from previous stories

### Docker Socket Security Considerations
- Mount Docker socket as read-only (:ro flag)
- Run cAdvisor with minimal privileges
- No external network access for cAdvisor container
- Monitor only, never control containers

## Testing
### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `tests/integration/test_cadvisor_setup.py`
- Test standards: pytest 8.x for Python testing
- Testing frameworks: Integration tests for service connectivity
- Specific requirements for this story:
  - Verify cAdvisor endpoint accessibility
  - Test Prometheus can scrape metrics successfully
  - Validate container labels and GPU detection
  - Check metric namespace compliance
  - Manual verification of UI access
